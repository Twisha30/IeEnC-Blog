      El Salvador officially adopted Bitcoin in September. However, the move by El Salvador has garnered some criticism from Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. El Salvador president Nayib Bukele has reportedly forced companies to accept Bitcoin after officially adopting the cryptocurrency as legal tender. This move has been criticised by Buterin as it seems to be driven by Bitcoin maximalist tendencies. Buterin expressed his anger in a Reddit discussion, where he shared his comment in response to a post by another user.
