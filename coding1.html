        A new chemical process for additive manufacturing suggests exciting possibilities for 4D printed componentsâ€”such as properties that change over time.Researchers at Loughborough University have developed a hybrid method called Material Treatment Extrusion Additive Manufacturing (MaTrEx-AM), which uses acetone to toughen targeted layers of 3D printed parts and structures.Varying how much acetone is applied and where it is used allows manufacturers to create items with novel mechanical properties, such controlling how parts deform.The ability to create these time-dependent gives the printing process a 4D aspect.Real-world applications include 4D lattices for helmet padding to avoid impact injuries and for biomedical implants.

        A U.S.-based economist won the Nobel prize for economics Monday for pioneering research that showed an increase in minimum wage does not lead to less hiring and immigrants do not lower pay for native-born workers, challenging commonly held ideas. Two others shared the award for creating a way to study these types of societal issue.Last week, the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to journalists Maria Ressa of the Philippines and Dmitry Muratov of Russia for their fight for freedom of expression in countries where reporters have faced persistent attacks, harassment and even murder.

        Hit hard by the pandemic, researchers expect its impacts to linger for years

       The impacts of COVID-19 on academic staff are not evenly distributed. There was a disproportionate gender impact, which is in line with previous reports across the sector. Impacts were greatest on academics in the early stages of their careers, often with young families.There is a need for both the government and universities to develop a long-term, tailored strategy to support the research community.
