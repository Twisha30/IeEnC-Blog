      With trends such as electrification, autonomous driving, and connected cars, the number of communication interfaces in vehicles is growing – whether wired or wireless. However, this development entails new challenges because the numerous communication channels create new attack surfaces increasing the vulnerability of the systems. Comprehensive security concepts are therefore becoming more important to support the safety of passengers and the protection of their data.
